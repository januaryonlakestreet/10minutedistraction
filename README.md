# 10minutedistraction


10 minute distraction was a project created to take part in 'the festival of code' for 2015, the competitions one real rule was that what ever you created must use some form of open data - in my case twitter via a python script.

the goal of my project was to use twitters api to monitor a hashtag, and to take each tweet and then use the text from each tweet as the 'seed' for a procedurally generated level, where upon an account set up for this would reply to the user allowing them to play the level that was created.


currently the project is fairly dated - it uses gamemaker studio instead of unity/ or javascript/html5 but the core parts do work namely the python script to record and reply to tweets and the gamemaker studio project *if built for web* would work currectly.
